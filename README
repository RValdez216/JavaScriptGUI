Here's my Attempt at a GUI in Javascript.

Theres a Main Home screen to help navigate through the other webpages.
There is a Port Scan screen to scan ports and it dynamically adds host to a result area and a combo box.
When a host is selected through the combo box it will be highlighted white ti make it easier to see.
The Ping screen is there but currently not functioning.

I had issues with the Css but the Javscript was alot easier to learn. Html is also pretty straightfoward.

The main code I have is just procedural, Its doesnt have a design pattern. I wanted to include the Facade and proxy pattern but Ran out of time.
The proxy pattern would have add a lazy loading bar to proxy the scan results.
I tried adding a proxy to the ping results but couldnt quite figure it out.
The facade pattern was going to be used through a rest client. I would use a fetch call to get the logic for the GUI to add it through a Facade.


Encapsulation:
The displayResult function encapsulates the logic for displaying scan results on the webpage.
It takes care of creating and updating the DOM elements related to the results. This function encapsulates the implementation details, providing a clear interface for displaying results.

State Management:
The scanResults array is used to store unique identifiers for each scan result.
It serves as a form of state management for the application.
The array is updated within the displayResult function.

Reusability:
The displayResult function is reusable, as it can be called multiple times to display different scan results.
This promotes a modular and reusable approach to handling the display of results.

Event Handling:
The event handling code for the dropdown (resultRef) and the scan button is well-organized,
 which aligns with the concept of handling events in an object-oriented manner.


 I had issues getting my code to work with electron and bootstrap,
 so I just left it in cordova and tried my best with the CSS.

 Overall it was really fun learning Javascript and making the network scanner has just been a really cool project.
 I plan on working on it in the future beyond the class with Aidan.
